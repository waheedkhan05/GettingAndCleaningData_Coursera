#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

**Waheed Khan**

========================================

This file describes how the script works.


* First, unzip the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.
* Make sure to make folder UCI HAR Dataset as current working directory so that the files features.txt,activity_labels.txt and folders test and train are accessible.
* I have used data table instead of simple data frame so there is a dependency on **data.table**. Make sure to download and install data.table package.
* Use source("run_analysis.R") command in RStudio or run the script after you have setup the working directory explained above.
* The script file will run and will output messages as it progresses.
* After successful completion, you will find two output files are generated in the current working directory:
  - cleaned_data.txt: it contains a data table called cleaned.data with 10299*81 dimensions.
  - dataset2.txt : it contains a data frame called result with 180*81 dimensions.
